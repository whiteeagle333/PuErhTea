      process of preparing and drinking Pu Erh tea can be seen as a form of
      meditation, requiring a focused and present mind. Practitioners may also
      use tea ceremonies as a way to cultivate a sense of community and

      have energetic and spiritual properties. Some practitioners believe that
      the tea can help to balance and harmonize the body's energy, or qi, and
